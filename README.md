# 🚲 Comprehensive Analysis of Bicycle Supply and Demand Dynamics  
### Author: Yufei Shang

## 📘 Project Overview 
This project presents an interactive data story analyzing **supply and demand dynamics in San Francisco’s bike-sharing system**.  
The goal is to identify **spatial and temporal imbalances**, highlight **optimization hotspots**, and simulate how operational changes could reduce supply-demand gaps.  


---

## 🧩 Methodology   
- **Data Source:** Google BigQuery public dataset — `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_trips`  
- **Tool:** Tableau Public for data cleaning, geospatial visualization, and dashboard storytelling  
- **Approach:**  
  - Hourly supply vs. demand visualization  
  - Median-based imbalance mapping  
  - Hotspot detection for optimization  
  - Pre–Post optimization comparison  

---

## 💡 Key Insights 
- **Temporal Imbalance:** Bike availability drops during morning and evening commute peaks, while dock demand spikes.  
- **Spatial Imbalance:** Undersupply areas cluster in downtown and along major commuter corridors.  
- **Optimization Impact:** Simulated relocation and dock expansion reduce imbalance to near zero at top 5 critical stations.
